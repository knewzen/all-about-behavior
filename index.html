             We understand that as a parent of a child with autism that you may experience information overload while coping with a diagnosis, which can be very emotional and overwhelming. We hope to alleviate some of that stress by providing you with research based methods while listening to your input and working to target goals in a way that works for your family and your child.<br>
             <br>We start with a parent interview, rapport building, and an assessment process that allows us to get to know you and your child better. We then set individualized goals based off the assessments and your valuable input as parents. With this we can begin treatment using the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis in 1:1 therapy.<br>
             <br>Using an intensive approach, we can target a variety of goals and incorporate functional learning opportunities that can help your child/adolescent to have success in a variety of settings.

                    Once assessment is completed, the behavior analyst will develop specific curriculum and programming to meet your child's needs. Using a combination of discrete trial and incidental teaching, learner's will receive one on one support to teach a variety of communication, academic, sensory motor, self-help, social and play skills.

                    When challenging behavior emerges, it is necessary to determine the cause or function maintaining the behavior. Therefore, a staff behavior analyst will systematically evaluate all the conditions under which the behavior occurs. This serves to fully develop appropriate support plans to not only reduce problem behavior, but also increase participation in positive behavior daily and allow the learner to reach the best possible outcomes.
